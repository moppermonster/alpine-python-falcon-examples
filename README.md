alpine-python-falcon examples

## About

These are examples to help you get started with https://github.com/moppermonster/alpine-python-falcon.

## Examples

### Example 00
This is the most basic way to use the `alpine-python-falcon` image and container.

### Example 01
This example adds a second "function" (class, resource instance and route).

This example also introduces `resp.status`.

### Example 02
In this example, we import one of our own scripts: `myfunction`.

This example adds a second method to `Numbers()` from the previous example.

### Example 03
In this example, we parse an incoming request for data.

### Example 04
In this example, we introduce a function that requires us to install some extra packages from a `requirements.txt` file.

### Example 05
This example uses `docker-compose` to overwrite files in the existing container. Therefore, this example does not require building it's own container.
